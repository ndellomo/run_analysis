## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is a repository for the course project for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data class as part of the Data Science Specalization.  Within this reporsitiry, I have saved my script, run_analysis.R, and my code book, CodeBook.m.  

The purpose of the R-script is to load in data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, combind the data and create a new tidy data set that can later be used to run additional analysis.  Information about the data can be found in my CodeBook.m


## Human Activity Using Smartphones Dataset
Download the data from the below link and save it into a working directory.

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Extract it into the data directory under your R working directory.

You can now run my R-script, run_analysis.R, to generate a text file named "Tidy.txt". This is the required data set for this project.

Good Luck!
